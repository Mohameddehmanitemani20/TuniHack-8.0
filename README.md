## Finding the right Dataset
After a lot of reaserch we found a dataset that is suitable for our project
## Context
Blood is the life-maintaining fluid that circulates through the body's heart, arteries, veins, and capillaries. It carries away waste products and brings nourishment, electrolytes, hormones, vitamins, antibodies, heat, and oxygen to the tissues.
Hemathology diseases are now a common public health health concern given their morbidity and comorbidity with other diseases ; they are disorders of the blood and blood-forming organs, afflict millions of people across the globe. In addition to blood cell cancers like leukemia, hematologic diseases include anemia, conditions related to HIV, sickle cell disease, and complications from chemotherapy or transfusions.
Leukemia is cancer that starts in young (immature) blood cells. Itâ€™s the most common kind of cancer in children.
and that's why we chose to takle this disease first. 
So in our project we chose to build a machine and deep learning model that helps doctors diagnose leukemia more effeciently.
## already available resources
The dataset that we used contains more than 5500 images of patients.
## Website description
An interface that displays the images sent by BloodSue camera (our project) with estimations of the patients being affected by leukemia.
Statistics of annual detection of leukemia that may facilates the doctor's job.
## Model description
We used the Efficient-Net B3 model which is a CNN based algorithme used for image processing and classification.
## Video shooting guidlines
These are the rules we imposed when we shot our video:

FPS (frames per second): 30

Min/Max quality: 720p

Orientation: horizental
